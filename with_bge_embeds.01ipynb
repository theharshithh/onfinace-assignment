            "\n",
            "1. **Hero MotoCorp** observed significant overall sales volumes despite a year-on-year decline. They sold 434,165 units in the recent reported period compared to 450,170 units in the prior corresponding period, reflecting a decrease of roughly 3.6%. However, on a sequential basis, there was an impressive recovery (from 394,460 in a previous period), and they have achieved a cumulative growth of 6.1% year-over-year.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. In comparison, **TVS Motor** reports sales of motorcycles at 137,970, witnessing a 14% decrease while scooters improved by 11.6% to 106,785 units. The negative growth in motorcycles might signal a concerning trend, albeit compensated by the growth in the scooter segment.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Bajaj Auto**, in collaboration with exported sales figures, reported a year-on-year decrease by 5.1% in overall delivery.\n",
            "\n",
            "Given these figures, while Hero MotoCorp reported a downturn short term, their broader strategic picture keeps them at the forefront of the two-wheeler segment overall by sheer volume of sales and visible recovery indicators in(month-to-month improvements). This suggests resilience and a possibly larger share or retention of customer base comparing cumulative sales growth amongst their peers. However, the specifics of market segment share—possibly in more lucrative categories such as scooters that have seen growth among competitors—would require additional sales breakdown information that isn’t provided here. Thus, without more precise segment data, attributing market leadership in specific categories (like motorcycles versus scooters) would be challenging.\n",
